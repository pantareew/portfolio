# Interactive Portfolio
## About this project
This is an interactive portfolio website inspired by the Marauder’s Map from Harry Potter.
Rather than using a traditional scroll-based layout, the site is designed as a spatial and story-driven experience where users explore content instead of passively reading it.

The interface focuses heavily on user engagement and narrative flow, using animated transitions, contextual instructions, and multiple navigation modes to guide users through different sections. The goal was to create a memorable experience that reflects both my technical skills and my approach to thoughtful and immersive UI design.
