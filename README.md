# Interactive Portfolio
## About this project
This is an interactive portfolio website inspired by the Marauder’s Map from Harry Potter.
Rather than using a traditional scroll-based layout, the site is designed as a spatial and story-driven experience where users explore content instead of passively reading it.

The interface focuses heavily on user engagement and narrative flow, using animated transitions, contextual instructions, and multiple navigation modes to guide users through different sections. The goal was to create a memorable experience that reflects both my technical skills and my approach to thoughtful and immersive UI design.

## Features
### Narrative Intro (Castle Entry)
Users begin at a castle entrance before entering the map, setting the tone and introducing the experience through storytelling rather than immediate content
### Marauder’s Map–Inspired Navigation
The main interface is a magical map where sections are positioned spatially instead of vertically, encouraging exploration over scrolling
### Dual Navigation Modes (Wand & Footprint)
- Wand Mode (Desktop):
Users reveal sections by pointing a wand, creating a playful and immersive interaction
- Footprint Mode (Mobile / Reveal All):
Animated footprints guide users to selected sections, ensuring usability across devices
### Animated Content Popup
Each section opens in a popup with page transitions and navigation buttons, allowing users to focus on one section at a time and keeping attention on the current story
### Micro-interactions
Subtle animations, transitions, and visual cues are used throughout to enhance feedback and immersion without overwhelming the user
